Queue Simulation:
Inter-arrival times are generated by the rand function, which has a uniform distribution. The random number is divided by RAND_MAX to obtain a value between 0 and 1. It is then put into a function to change the value to an exponential distribution. Service times are also generated in the same manner.

Wait times are calculated by subtracting the arrival time and the departure time for all ‘customers’ and taking the average. 
To calculate queue length, departures and arrivals, the algorithm provided in the class slideshow was used.

Average CPU usage is computed by summing up all the service times and dividing by the total time. All statistics are written to a text file.
